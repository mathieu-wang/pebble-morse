# pebble-morse

Pebble-Morse is a simple and instructive game, allowing anyone to learn Morse Code, while having loads of fun. It is a standalone Pebble Watchapp, meaning that it does not need a mobile companion application.

Pebble-Morse has 3 levels of difficulty, each with 10 levels. 

At each stage, the player receives a series of vibrations, representing either a letter, a word, or a sentence in Morse Code.

Then the player must choose the right answer corresponding to the Morse Code that he or she just observed.

The player gains 10 points for each correct response, and 0 for an incorrect one.

A local high score is kept in the app to show the player's progress.
